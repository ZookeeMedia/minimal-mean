## Why Minimal MEAN?
It can be daunting to pick the right stack to deliver your idea to the cloud. Without realizing, you can introduce one too many "sandbag of complexity" between you and something you can release. For the first time ever it is possible to do full-stack development with a consistent set of tools and best practices using the same language, JavaScript. No more to context switching between front-end and back-end languages, libraries and tools. That is The JavaScript Promise. My easy to learn and use stack 'Minimal MEAN' will get you started and deployed on the cloud over a lazy weekend, without requiring a MongoDB install, while leveraging the latest tools like async/await with Typescript, ng2, Node v5.

## TODO
- [ ] Use Angular CLI https://github.com/angular/angular-cli for client-side app setup
- [ ] Add Angular Material https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/guides/getting-started.md
- [ ] Material, working examples https://material2-app.firebaseapp.com/ and https://github.com/kara/leashed-in
- [ ] HTTPS using Let's Encrypt
- [ ] Sanitize inputs using TypeScript interfaces with https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator.ts
- [ ] Dockerize, because https://gist.github.com/duluca/25de70e41347f38b2283ef90ed69840a
- [ ] Simplify build process to only really on npm scripts https://gist.github.com/duluca/4468df69f04d60478af824c23fe094f9
